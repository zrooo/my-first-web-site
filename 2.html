<p>CSS is designed <u>to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</u> This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"> web pages </a> to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
<p style="margin-top:10px">The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
